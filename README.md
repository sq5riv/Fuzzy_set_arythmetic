# fuzzy_arythmetic

This project implements arithmetic operations for fuzzy sets using Python. It provides a way to perform calculations with uncertain or imprecise data, leveraging fuzzy logic principles.

## Features
- Representation of fuzzy sets convex and nonconvex (multimodal)
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) with T-norm



## Installation 
This project uses Python 3.10
and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. 
To install, run:

```sh
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
## Use examples
To try Fuzzy-set-arythmetic you need to run

```sh
poetry install --with examples
```
and run

```sh 
poetry run jupyter notebook examples/fuzzy_review.ipynb 
```
